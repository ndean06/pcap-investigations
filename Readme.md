# 📦 PCAP Investigations

This repository contains **network-based security investigations** conducted using packet capture (PCAP) analysis.  
Each case demonstrates how malicious activity can be identified, scoped, and explained **using only network traffic**, without reliance on SIEM or endpoint telemetry.

The focus is on **analyst thinking**, evidence-driven conclusions, and clear incident reporting.
